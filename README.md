# SDATA

## TP-LDA

It is a work on iris dataset for classification using Linear Discriminant Analysis. In this project, I work on :
- Data Visualization (pairplot, TSNE)
- Calculation of the LDA manually
- Comparison with sklearn LDA
- Training phases with train_test_split or K-fold and comparison with f1_score
- Display of decision_boundaries
